## Introduction

Kubernetes Dashboard is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to manage applications running in the cluster and troubleshoot them, as well as manage the cluster itself.

## Getting Started

**IMPORTANT:** Read the [Access Control](docs/user/access-control/README.md) guide before performing any further steps. The default Dashboard deployment contains a minimal set of RBAC privileges needed to run.

## Installation

Kubernetes Dashboard supports both Helm and Manifest-based installation. Since release `v3.0.0` using Helm Chart should be faster and simpler in general as it will install
dependencies such as `cert-manager`, `nginx-ingress-controller` and `metrics-server` for you. In case you are using different software to handle certificates, ingress/egress traffic, etc.
it is possible to disable those dependencies by overriding [helm chart values](charts/helm-chart/kubernetes-dashboard/values.yaml).

### Helm

You can install Dashboard using Helm as described [here](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/k8s-dashboard/kubernetes-dashboard).

### Manifest

You can install Dashboard using `kubectl` as described in the installation instructions that can be found in the [latest release](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/releases/latest).

## Access

You can access Dashboard as described in the instructions that can be found in the [access guide](docs/user/accessing-dashboard/README.md).

## Create An Authentication Token (RBAC)
To find out how to create sample user and log in follow [Creating sample user](docs/user/access-control/creating-sample-user.md) guide.

**NOTE:**
* Kubeconfig Authentication method does not support external identity providers or certificate-based authentication.
* [Metrics-Server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) has to be running in the cluster for the metrics and graphs to be available. Read more about it in [Integrations](docs/user/integrations.md) guide.

## Documentation

Dashboard documentation can be found on [docs](docs/README.md) directory which contains:

* [Common](docs/common/README.md): Entry-level overview.
* [User Guide](docs/user/README.md): [Accessing Dashboard](docs/user/accessing-dashboard/README.md) and more for users.
* [Developer Guide](docs/developer/README.md): [Getting Started](docs/developer/getting-started.md), [Dependency Management](docs/developer/dependency-management.md) and more for anyone interested in contributing.
